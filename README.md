## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get insight in the current market of Berlin rooms.
Real-estate pricing in Berlin has increased extremely since the last years and the current information is not up-to-date.
Since I just moved to Berlin and have to find a room, this will help me and other students.

## Project Description
The rooms data comes from ebay-kleinanzeigen.de, one of the biggest private house markets. Multiple features are scraped straight from advertisments for the duration of 1 week. 
Some question I had before starting. 
- What the price per square meter is for each area.
- Most affordable area to live for students
