## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get insight in the current market of Berlin rooms.
Real-estate pricing in Berlin has increased extremely since the last years and the room pricing found online is not up-to-date. I just moved to Berlin and have to find a room, this will help me and other students.

## Project Description
The rooms data comes from ebay-kleinanzeigen.de, one of the biggest private house markets. Multiple features are scraped straight from advertisments for the duration of 1 week. Commercial owners know the average price since it is there job. But finding out a good price in the market for a regular joe is quite hard. With the avaible data I will predict prices for private people that would like to rent out a room but are not sure what to ask for it.

Some question I had before starting. 
- What the price per square meter in the different area of Berlin.
- The most affordable area to live for students
